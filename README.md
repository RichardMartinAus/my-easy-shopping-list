# My Easy Shopping List

## Description

This app was created using a full MERN stack. The concept is to make an app that is easy to use to create reuseable shopping lists. List can be saved, updated and easily customised by the user once an account is created.

This is an on-going project and more functionality will be added over time.

The components were created using Ant Design component library.
